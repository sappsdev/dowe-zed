# Dowe Zed

Dowe Zed is the dedicated Zed extension repository for Dowe Source Format files.

This repository contains the Zed extension adapter, language metadata, Tree-sitter queries, icon metadata, and the Dowe Tree-sitter grammar used by Zed. It recognizes `.dowe` files as `Dowe` and starts `dowe-language-server` over stdio.

The extension is maintained here directly. It is not generated from, embedded in, or installed through another Dowe repository.

## Requirements

- Zed with Rust extension development support.
- Rust installed through `rustup`.
- The `wasm32-wasip2` Rust target for local adapter builds.

The extension does not require Node.js, `node_modules`, npm, Prettier, or ESLint.

## Local Development

Install the Rust target used by Zed extensions if it is not already present:

```sh
rustup target add wasm32-wasip2
```

Prepare the local grammar mirror used by Zed dev extension installs:

```sh
./scripts/bootstrap-grammar-repo.sh
```

The bootstrap script creates `.zed-dev/tree-sitter-dowe.git` from the bundled `tree-sitter-dowe` directory and updates the grammar `rev` in `extension.toml`. Run it again after changing the grammar.

Build the extension adapter:

```sh
cargo check --target wasm32-wasip2
```

Install the extension in Zed with `zed: install dev extension` and select this repository directory.

The extension also provides the `Dowe Icons Dark` and `Dowe Icons Light` icon themes. Select one from Zed's icon theme selector to use the Dowe logo for `.dowe` files in the project panel.

Run local validation:

```sh
./scripts/check.sh
```

## View Syntax

The grammar recognizes the built-in `Input`, `Select`, and `Option` form controls. Completion and diagnostic support for their props is provided by `dowe-language-server`.

```text
Input label:"Email" placeholder:"name@example.com" labelFloating:true variant:"outlined" scheme:"primary"
Select label:"Role" placeholder:"Choose a role" labelFloating:true variant:"soft" scheme:"secondary"
  Option value:"admin" label:"Administrator" description:"Manage users"
  Option value:"viewer" label:"Viewer"
```

`Input` recognizes `label`, `placeholder`, and `labelFloating` through language-server support. `Select` recognizes the same visual props plus `bind`, `variant`, and `scheme`; direct `Option` children use `value`, `label`, and optional `description`. Every static string prop uses double quotes, including design tokens and enum values, so the language server flags `Option value:admin`, `Path fill:none`, `variant:outlined`, and `scheme:primary`. Resolved references such as `bind:profile.role` and `onClick:save` remain bare.

## Language Server

The published extension must not depend on a private Dowe checkout. By default, the adapter asks Zed to download `dowe-language-server` from public release assets on `dowe-lang/dowe-zed`.

Each release that should provide language-server features needs these assets:

```text
dowe-language-server-darwin-aarch64.tar.gz
dowe-language-server-darwin-x86_64.tar.gz
dowe-language-server-linux-aarch64.tar.gz
dowe-language-server-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
dowe-language-server-windows-aarch64.zip
dowe-language-server-windows-x86_64.zip
```

Each archive should contain the executable at its root:

- `dowe-language-server` for macOS and Linux.
- `dowe-language-server.exe` for Windows.

For local development only, a `dowe-language-server` binary on `PATH` is still accepted as a fallback or through Zed LSP binary settings.

## Publishing

Before publishing to the Zed extension registry, `extension.toml` must point at a public grammar source. Zed allows a Tree-sitter grammar to live in a subdirectory by using `path = "tree-sitter-dowe"`.

After committing grammar changes, prepare the manifest for publication:

```sh
./scripts/prepare-publish.sh
```

This changes the grammar entry to use `https://github.com/dowe-lang/dowe-zed`, the current `HEAD` commit, and `path = "tree-sitter-dowe"`.

Then open a PR to `zed-industries/extensions` that adds this repository as a submodule under `extensions/dowe` and adds the matching version to `extensions.toml`.
